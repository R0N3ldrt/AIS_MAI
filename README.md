Explainable Artificial Intelligence DEMO

Pre-requirements:

- installed shap
- installed lime
- installed interpret

Under the DEMO 1 file we presend three of the most common python libraries fro Explainable AI (XAI). The libraries presented are the following:

- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- InterpretML

The dataset utlized for this demo is the wine dataset from UCI machine repository. This dataset consist of the results from an chemical analysis of wines grown in Italy from three different cultivars located in the same region.
